		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p class="abstract">
			The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, yet they might be attacked to produce harmful content. Despite efforts to ethically align LLMs, these are often fragile and can be circumvented by jailbreaking attacks through optimized or manual adversarial prompts. To address this, we introduce the <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #c03d3e;">I</span>nformation <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #c03d3e;">B</span>ottleneck <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #c03d3e;">Protector</span> (<span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #c03d3e;">IBProtector</span>), a defense mechanism grounded in the information bottleneck principle, and we modify the objective to avoid trivial solutions. The IBProtector selectively compresses and perturbs prompts, facilitated by a lightweight and trainable extractor, preserving only essential information for the target LLMs to respond with the expected answer. Moreover, we further consider a situation where the gradient is not visible to be compatible with any LLM. Our empirical evaluations show that IBProtector outperforms current defense methods in mitigating jailbreak attempts, without overly affecting response quality or inference speed. Its adaptability across various attack methods and target LLMs underscore the potential of IBProtector as a novel, transferable defense that bolsters the security of LLMs without requiring modifications to the underlying models.

    <br>
    Current perturbations may not trigger a defence of the target LLM.<br> Can we perturb adversarial prompts more effectively beyond mere randomness?

			<p>
				We propose <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #c03d3e;">IBProtector</span>, the first LLM jailbreak defending method based on the Information Bottleneck principle
in the perspective of information compression, and give a traceable objective function. The
method is lightweight and requires no modifications to the LLMs. <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #c03d3e;">IBProtector</span> is empirically generalizable to different attack strategies and
target LLMs, highlighting its potential as a transferable defense mechanism. We evaluate <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #c03d3e;">IBProtector</span> on token-level and prompt-level jailbreaking datasets. The results show that <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #c03d3e;">IBProtector</span> can successfully defend against adversarial prompts without
substantially affecting LLMs’ responsiveness and inference consumption.
